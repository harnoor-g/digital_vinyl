        <p>There's a special feeling involved in hearing somebody tell a story. A feeling that's becoming unknown to our generation. Our elders loved to tell stories, and their stories would love to be heard.
        Digital Vinyl is here to bring back the beauty of hearing a story. 
        We want to provide our elderly with an easy way to share the amazing stories of their lives with us, 
        so we can enjoy and learn from these stories at the click of a button.</p>

            <h3>How did Digital Vinyl originate?</h3>
            <div id="about2">
        
        <p> Digital Vinyl was made to give the elderly in our community a way to connect with the outside world, 
        at a time when New Zealand as a nation went into self-isolation.
            </p>
            <h3>What more do we want from Digital Vinyl?</h3>
        <p>In today's day and age, social media has us constantly updated on everything going on with the people around us. There's never any need for a story to be told because it has already been posted about!
        Firstly, we all know our oldie goodies love telling stories. Along with listening to comedian podcasts and watching scripted television,
        we aim to remind people of the authenticity of hearing a story recounted first-hand.
